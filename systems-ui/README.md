# Systems API

Dashboard for SUSE systems built with react. It uses the systems-api to gather all the needed data.

## Start project

### Requirements
1. Nodejs
2. Npm

### Start server
1. yarn install
2. yarn start

## Options
### Configuration

This project started as a create react app. I ended up ejecting the react app configuration because I needed some custom 
configurations (css-modules). If I had the need to keep working on this project I would probably keep all the custom 
configuration in different files in order to be easier to keep track of create-react-app changes.
